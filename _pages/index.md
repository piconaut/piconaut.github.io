### Hi, I'm Amy!

I do a lot of programming and data analysis, because it engages and excites me like nothing else. I love taking raw information from interesting sources and sculpting it into useful and beautiful insights. More generally, I love creating things that I can be proud of: things with purpose or intrigue or charm, and things that just make people smile.

I just completed my Master's degree in Astronomy at Western University, where I conducted a spectroscopic study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the interstellar medium. That and other projects are listed on my Projects page.

Having just graduated, I'm looking for a job! If you have one of those, or if you just want to chat about things I've worked on, add me on [linkedin.com/in/amyfare/](LinkedIn) or send me an email: amy (at) amyfare (dot) ca
