### Hi, I'm Amy!

Lately I've been making some little mainframe-related web trinkets.

Having just graduated, I'm looking for a job! If you have one of those, or if you just want to chat about things I've worked on, add me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/amyfare/) or send me an email: amy (at) amyfare (dot) ca
