title: Writing a basic flashcards app
description: I started developing a basic flashcards app for Android!
---

A lot of people procrastinate more involved endeavours like work or projects by cooking an entire three-course meal or cleaning their entire house. I'm often the opposite: sometimes I dearly wish I could cook or clean, because my leftovers are running out or my room's become a disaster, but I can't just because it doesn't really engage me. When I'm lucky, I procrastinate by starting a personal project - preferably a really tiny one that I can bang out in one day.

So yesterday I made a Android app that does flashcards for studying purposes! Terrible timing, since I just finished school. It's super simple with not many features, but I still learned from it, since I haven't done a huge amount of Android development before.

First, you add a card, inputting a question and answer:
