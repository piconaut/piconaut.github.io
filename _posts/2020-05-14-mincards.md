title: Writing a basic flashcards app
description: I started developing a basic flashcards app for Android!
---

A lot of people procrastinate more involved endeavours like work or projects by cooking an entire three-course meal or cleaning their entire house. I'm often the opposite: sometimes I dearly wish I could cook or clean, because my leftovers are running out or my room's become a disaster, but I can't just because it doesn't really engage me. When I'm lucky, I procrastinate by starting a personal project - preferably a really tiny one that I can bang out in one day.

So yesterday I made a Android app that does flashcards for studying purposes! Terrible timing, since I just finished school. It's super simple with not many features, but it was enough to distract me.

On the "add" screen, you add card, inputting a question and answer, or delete all the cards in the deck:

<center><img src="mincards_add.jpg" alt="Adding a flashcard" width="314" height="537"></center>

Then, on the "view" screen, you can view the flashcards' questions in a randomized order, show the answer corresponding to the currently displayed question, and delete the current question/answer pair:

<center><img src="mincards_view.jpg" alt="Viewing a flashcard" width="631" height="537"></center>

Cards are stored as binary in app-specific storage.

If I get bored again, I might implement:
- Scrollable view of flashcard deck, allowing editing/deleting of individual cards
- Edit card on "view" screen

I'd also like to add LaTeX support, although that might be a bit more involved.

I might put it on the Play Store just in case anyone's looking for a feature-poor flashcard app!
